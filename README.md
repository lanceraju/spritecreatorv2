# spritecreatorv2
This was the first coding project I ever had to work on for a Java class. Currently, it is just limited to make ellipses and rectangles.
Colors, rotations, and size are user-specified. Rotation can occur on the last sprite created by a factor of 15 degree clockwise
or counter-clockwise. If a specific rotation is given, then it will be applied to the next sprite created. Lastly, an undo button exists
to remove each sprite from the canvas.


Enjoy!
